<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to my page! Here's a brief intro about me:
</p>
<p>
    In November 2023, I completed my master's degree 
    (<a href="https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/egegmpmeg">MPhil in Engineering</a>)
    at <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge University</a> in the
    <a href="https://physcomp.eng.cam.ac.uk">Physical Computation Laboratory</a>, a research group within the
    <a href="https://ee.eng.cam.ac.uk">Electrical Engineering Division</a>, under the supervision of Prof
    <a href="https://www.phillipstanleymarbell.org">Phillip Stanley-Marbell</a>. My
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03534">thesis</a> was on evaluating the performance of Physics-informed
    Neural Networks (PINNs) for physical systems based on real-world data collected from experimental setups.
</p>

<p>
    Before my master's, I worked as an embedded systems engineer for one year (June 2021 — June 2022) at a
    company in Riyadh that develops secure communication devices.
</p>

<p>
    In 2021, I completed my bachelor's degree (BS) in <a href="https://coe.kfupm.edu.sa">Computer Engineering</a>
    at <a href="https://kfupm.edu.sa">King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM)</a>. For my final
    year project, I worked with Ahmed Alharbi to design a high-speed FPGA-based accelerator design for
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means clustering</a> for
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation">image segmentation</a>. Our final design achieved
    a final speedup over the base sequential hardware implementation of around 58x.
</p>

<p>
    During my bachelor's I studied abroad for a semester at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>
    (August — December 2019), where I was also a resident of <a href="https://ihouse.gatech.edu">I-House</a>.

<h1>Research Interests</h1>
<p>
    I do research on two main topics:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Machine learning approaches that can be
            applied to physical systems and on real-world data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Accelerated computing that can be deployed within physical
            systems that is driven by real-world data.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    For the first point, I believe that pure data-driven machine learning
    models, that operate within physical systems, are limited by their framing
    as black box predictors that lack an empirical understanding of the systems
    that they exist in. An alternative approach is encode physical information
    pertaining to systems into the training process, such as conservation laws,
    governing equations, dimensional consistency, or noise characteristics. This
    so-called physics-informed machine learning approach leads to models that
    are more robust and adaptable to the ever-changing conditions of dynamical 
    systems in the real world.
</p>

<p>
    For the second, I am interested in improving computation that is deployed
    within physical and autonomous systems from an architectural perspective.
    General purpose computing that has relied on making CPUs faster and smaller
    is not optimal for physical systems and domain-specific tasks. These systems
    commonly interface with one or more sensors, often at high speeds, and must 
    produce actuation outputs within strict deadlines. A better approach to this
    is to develop accelerator architectures that perform processing at the
    hardware level, and exploit different levels of parallelism to achieve higher
    throughputs, lower power consumption, and better resource utilization. FPGAs
    are promising as candidate platforms for this.
</p>

<p>
    These two themes are intertwined, and an intersection area that I also think about
    is the acceleration of physics-informed machine learning methods, and how to develop
    customised architectures that are tailored to their deployment in real-world
    settings.
